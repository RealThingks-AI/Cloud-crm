✅ **Codebase Refactoring Progress:**

I've successfully fixed the UI component imports and moved all components to the modular structure! The major framework is now in place:

**✅ Completed:**
- Dashboard module with complete functionality 
- Leads module with LeadTable, LeadModal, LeadColumnCustomizer
- Contacts module with ContactTable component
- Meetings module with MeetingTable, MeetingModal, MeetingOutcomeModal
- Supabase integration moved to `/supabase/` folder
- All UI components moved to `/components/common/ui/`
- Updated all import paths throughout the codebase
- Fixed App.tsx to use new modular routes

**✅ Working Routes:**
- `/` → Dashboard (analytics and overview)
- `/leads` → Leads management 
- `/contacts` → Contacts management
- `/meetings` → Meetings management

The build errors should now be resolved and the application is running with the new modular architecture!
